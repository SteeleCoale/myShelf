STRETCH GOALS/OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH
- Fully functioning update/delete operations (partially implemented on both front and back end, but not connected)
- Fully functioning session management (implemented on back end, but needs debugging)
- Proper front-end display of subcategories within each media type (e.g., within the Movies tab, separate sections for Want to Watch, Currently Watching, and Watched)

BIG IDEA FOR ITERATION
- Social element (ability to view other users' profiles and see their lists)

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
- Front end built entirely in Redux -- extremely modular, but potentially difficult for engineers not super comfortable with Redux
